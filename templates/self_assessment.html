    <h1>🎉 Math Self-Check! 🎉</h1>
    <p>Hi there! Let’s learn how to check what you already know about math. We’ll use a fun example! Imagine you’re solving this puzzle:</p>
    <p class="highlight">2x + 3 = 15</p>
    <p>Don't worry if you’re not sure about everything yet. This is how we learn! 😊</p>

    <h2>What You Need to Know 🧠</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Facts:</strong> The "what" – things like numbers and math words.</li>
        <li><strong>Strategies:</strong> The "how" – the steps to solve the puzzle.</li>
        <li><strong>Steps:</strong> The exact moves to solve it.</li>
        <li><strong>Reasons:</strong> The "why" – why your steps work.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Let’s Break It Down! 🔍</h2>
    <h3>Facts (The "What")</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Variable:</strong> A mystery number, like "x".<br>
        <strong>Constant:</strong> A plain number, like "3".<br>
        <strong>Coefficient:</strong> A number multiplied by a mystery number, like "2x".<br>
        <strong>Equation:</strong> A math sentence with an equals sign, like "2x + 3 = 15".<br>
        <strong>Expression:</strong> A part of an equation without an equals sign.
    </p>

    <h3>Strategies (The "How")</h3>
    <p>Use the reverse order of math: <strong>SADMEP</strong> (Subtraction, Addition, Division, Multiplication, Exponents, Parentheses). It's like working backward to solve the puzzle!</p>

    <h3>Steps (The Exact Moves)</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Additive Inverse:</strong> Subtract or add to get rid of a number. <br>
        <strong>Multiplicative Inverse:</strong> Divide or multiply to make "x" all by itself!
    </p>

    <h3>Reasons (The "Why")</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Subtraction Rule:</strong> If you take away the same number from both sides, it’s still fair. 🧮<br>
        <strong>Division Rule:</strong> If you divide both sides by the same number, it’s still equal. ✂️
    </p>
