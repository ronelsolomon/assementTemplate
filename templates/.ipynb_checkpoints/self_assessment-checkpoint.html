    <h1>Self Assessment Template: Math</h1>
    <p>
        I want to teach you how to assess your own knowledge about a subject area. Letâ€™s do this by taking an example that you already know. Suppose you wanted to assess your own knowledge about solving 2-step equations of the form <code>ax + b = c</code>. An example of this type of problem is <code>2x + 3 = 15</code>.
    </p>
    <h2>Types of Knowledge</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Facts:</strong> Concepts you have that describe objects or elements.</li>
        <li><strong>Strategies:</strong> General processes to solve a problem.</li>
        <li><strong>Procedures:</strong> Specific steps used in a strategy.</li>
        <li><strong>Rationales:</strong> Reasons why strategies or procedures work.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Self Assessment Example</h2>
    <h3>Facts</h3>
    <p>
        Variables, constants, coefficients, equations, and expressions. Examples: <br>
        <strong>Variable:</strong> An unknown quantity, usually represented by a letter.<br>
        <strong>Constant:</strong> A specific number.<br>
        <strong>Coefficient:</strong> A number multiplied by a variable.<br>
        <strong>Equation:</strong> An expression equal to another expression.<br>
        <strong>Expression:</strong> One or more terms combined using mathematical operations.
    </p>
    <h3>Strategies</h3>
    <p>
        Reverse order of operations: SADMEP (Subtraction, Addition, Division, Multiplication, Exponents, Parentheses). Example: Unsure about order of subtraction vs. addition or division vs. multiplication.
    </p>
    <h3>Procedures</h3>
    <p>
        Additive inverse: Adding the opposite sign constant to both sides. <br>\n        Multiplicative inverse: Multiplying both sides by the inverse of the coefficient. Question: Should the inverse be negative if the coefficient is negative?
    </p>
    <h3>Rationales</h3>
    <p>
        Subtraction property of equality: Subtracting the same number preserves equality.<br>\n        Division property of equality: Dividing by the same number preserves equality.
    </p>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>\n        Review your understanding of facts, strategies, procedures, and rationales. Identify areas where you need further learning and focus on addressing gaps.\n    </p>\n</body>\n</html>\n
